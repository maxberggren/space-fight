some improvements i want:
- the shot is not showing before it's some distance away from the player. let's make it show from the initial point of shooting.
- add a crosshair a small distance from the from the player. showing the direction that the shot will be shot to.
- make the players, instead of balls, a small triangular with the nose in the direction that its traveling.
- make the shots a bit smaller balls than currently and fully yellow and moving slightly slower
